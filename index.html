                    <p class="pg-4">"This is the time to redesign. The most important step in the redesigning process would be to create options for people. Our present system doesn't offer any options. Its obstinacy and rigidity have taken away the capacity for self-corrections. If we replace it with a system that provides options to everyone regarding all basic economic decisions, a corrective mechanism will come into play and steer the system in the right direction. It is difficult to orient the older generation to get used to having options and making their own decisions because they were never introduced to these options."</p>
